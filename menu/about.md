Hi there, I am Fabian. I am about to finish my PhD at the Department of Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam, where I worked on topics related to [Bayesian testing](https://fabiandablander.com/r/Law-of-Practice.html), [causal inference](https://fabiandablander.com/r/Causal-Inference.html), and [early warning signals for tipping points](https://fabiandablander.com/r/Dynamical-Systems.html). You can view my academic work [here](https://fabiandablander.com/menu/papers.html).

Outside of my academic work, I am eager to use data and data science to advance the social good. To that end, I co-founded [CorrelAid Nederland](https://correlaid.nl/), [Science versus Corona](https://scienceversuscorona.com/), and was a [Data Science for Social Good](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in 2022.

I am also deeply concerned about the [climate emergency](https://fabiandablander.com/menu/climate.html) and am heavily involved with [Scientist Rebellion](https://www.scientistrebellion.nl/).

I greatly enjoy teaching and have given workshops on a variety of topics, including [Bayesian statistics](https://fabiandablander.com/assets/talks/Bayes-Tutorial-Santa-Fe.html), [causal inference](https://fabiandablander.com/assets/talks/Causal-Workshop-Max-Planck.html), [epidemiological modeling](https://r.qhelp.eu/qhelp/qhelp/Presentations/Epidemiology-Workshop/), and [climate action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYEFV4feVBs). I always strive to make the learning experience fun and engaging. If you want me to give a workshop on any of these topics, please get in touch. I am happy to give workshops on climate and climate action for free; for workshops on other topics I request a fee in order to keep the lights on.

I am also available for statistical consulting or short-term project work. You can reach me on email using my last name dot my first name at gmail dot com.

<!-- I began my academic journey in Graz, Austria, where I studied Psychology and Philosophy. Dissatisfied with both, I looked for a more formal way to study the human mind and behaviour and ended up in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, pursuing a Masters degree in Cognitive Science.

For my thesis, I stepped out the ivory tower academia can sometimes be and worked with a car company on evaluating artificial driver models in their traffic simulation. While that was fun, academia is fun too, and so I started a PhD at the Department of Psychological Methods, University of Amsterdam, in December 2017. Broadly speaking, I am working on topics related to Bayesian inference and testing, networks, causal inference, and dynamical systems.

Besides academic things, I am thinking about how we can utilize people's quantitative skills for the social good. To that end, I co-founded [CorrelAid Nederland](https://twitter.com/CorrelAidxNL), [Data & Strategies versus Corona](https://scienceversuscorona.com/), and was a [Data Science For Social Good Fellow](https://www.dssgfellowship.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University in 2022. I am also deeply concerned about the [climate emergency](https://fabiandablander.com/menu/climate.html) and [helped organize](https://www.folia.nl/international/151115/scientist-rebellion-organizes-climate-action-week-time-to-look-up) and [took part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYFhadxD0eg) in the global Scientist Rebellion.
