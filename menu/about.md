I began my academic journey in Graz, Austria, where I studied Psychology and Philosophy. Dissatisfied with both, I looked for a more formal way to study the human mind and behaviour and ended up in TÃ¼bingen, Germany, pursuing a Masters degree in Cognitive Science.


For my thesis, I stepped out the ivory tower academia can sometimes be and worked with a car company on evaluating artificial driver models in their traffic simulation. While that was fun, academia is fun too, and so I started a PhD at the Department of Psychological Methods, University of Amsterdam, in December 2017. Broadly speaking, I am working on topics related to Bayesian inference and testing, networks, causal inference, and dynamical systems.

Besides academic things, I am thinking about how we can utilize people's quantitative skills for the social good. To that end, I co-founded [CorrelAid Nederland](https://twitter.com/CorrelAidxNL) and [Data & Strategies versus Corona](https://scienceversuscorona.com/). I am also deeply concerned about the [climate emergency](https://fabiandablander.com/menu/climate.html) and [helped organize](https://www.folia.nl/international/151115/scientist-rebellion-organizes-climate-action-week-time-to-look-up) and [took part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYFhadxD0eg) in the global Scientist Rebellion.
