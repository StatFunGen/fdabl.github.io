We are in a [climate emergency](https://fabiandablander.com/Climate-Impacts.html). And it is getting late.

We thus need to act swiftly and with resolve, yet governments around the world are moving either [too slowly or in the wrong direction](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/). To put pressure on them and force change, we need to build the largest, most inclusive social movement in history. Climate action has to move from something that others do to something that [we all engage in](https://twitter.com/climatehuman/status/1315065413500166144). Each and everyone of us has a role to play — this is humanity's decisive decade.

Education is an important first step. Personally, I became aware of the [enormous scale and urgency](https://fabiandablander.com/Climate-Impacts.html) of the crisis only recently, starting in the summer of 2020, when the ongoing Covid disaster compelled me to take a deeper look at the (scientific) literature. Below are some resources that I have found useful on my journey so far; note that they are in no particular order. Some of the things I have learned are summarized in a [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYEFV4feVBs).

I will try to add to this list going forward, and I hope that some things are useful to you.

- [Levers of Power](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3181-levers-of-power)
    - This extremely well-researched book is nothing short of eye-opening, detailing how big corporations use their structural power over the economy — chiefly derived from their control of the investment of capital — to exert enormous influence on political decision-making. The book also describes how past social movements have disrupted business in order to achieve progress reform. Highly recommended!
- [Climate Change as Class War](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60694943-climate-change-as-class-war)

Well worth a close read!
- [How We Win](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40068449-how-we-win)

One cannot imagine a better companion to explore the many complexities of feeding the world without devouring the planet than [George Monbiot](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgemonbiot).

    - Filled with insightful statistics, astute observations, and original calculations, this is a good book to better understand the challenges of (rapid) decarbonization. Ignoring the author's smugness may at times be difficult, however.
- [Merchants of Doubt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7799004-merchants-of-doubt)
    - This is one of the best and most sobering books I have ever read. Beware of science (and scientists) motivated by ideology. There exists a [documentary](https://www.documentarymania.com/player.php?title=Merchants%20of%20Doubt) of the same name, and you might also enjoy [this interview](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/02/04/episode-33-naomi-oreskes-on-climate-change-and-the-distortion-of-scientific-facts/) with Naomi Oreskes.

A book that deserves to be re-read from time to time.
- [Earth4All](https://www.earth4all.life/)
    - 50 years after *Limits to Growth*, this book uses a novel system dynamics model to explore what turnarounds — from reducing inequality to transforming the food system — are required to move from our current *Too Little, Too Late* scenario towards the *Giant Leap*. It is a masterclass in using models to narratively explore possible futures, and provides many concrete policy proposals that are worth [exploring in greater depth](https://www.earth4all.life/publications).
- [Think Like a Commoner](http://thinklikeacommoner.com/)
    - There is the market and then there is the state, right? No! There is also the vast space occupied by the commons. David Bollier, who also runs a [great podcast](https://david-bollier.simplecast.com/), provides a well-written and indeed mind-expanding introduction to the commons.

    - [Degrowth](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2020.1812222) is an eminently sensible proposal [worthy of discussion](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dpr.12584) and consideration.

    - Wonderful short film with and about George Monbiot, who has been at it [for decades](https://www.monbiot.com/about/) and shows no signs of relenting — a true inspiration.

- [The End of the Line](https://www.dartmouthfilms.com/theendoftheline)
    - Overfishing. Overfishing. Overfishing.
- [Cowspiracy](https://www.cowspiracy.com/)
    - Motivated me to look into the environmental footprint of meat and dairy in 2015, which caused me to switch to a plant-based diet. The benefits to planet and personal health are obvious — I've never looked back. Industrial agriculture alone could [blow our carbon budget](https://ourworldindata.org/food-emissions-carbon-budget), and switching to a plant-rich diet is the strongest mitigation option.
- [Seaspiracy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14152756/)
    - Similar in spirit as *Cowspiracy*. Informative but also slightly annoying.
- [Kiss the Ground](https://kisstheground.com/)
    - This documentary is uplifting and full of information, charting a promising path away from industrial agriculture (but always remember that there are no silver bullets).
- [SEED: The Untold Story](https://www.seedthemovie.com/trailer)
    - This is a very informative documentary about the epic history of seeds, the [vulnerability of our food system](https://www.theguardian.com/food/ng-interactive/2022/apr/14/climate-crisis-food-systems-not-ready-biodiversity), the powers that perpetuate injustice, and an alternative way of feeding the world that is both more sustainable and more resilient.
- [The End of Poverty?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xpKKHcC8eU)
    - You thought it was bad? You ain't seen nothing yet.
- [Capitalism: A Love Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK4H79j1I4A)
    - It is always good to remind oneself about what they are getting away with. We might not have the money, but we do have the numbers. And therein lies great power.
- [The Four Horsemen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fbvquHSPJU)
    - Great selection of topics and guests. "I don't think there is anything deeper than what's on the surface. Intellectuals have to make it look complicated, that's part of their job."
- [Gasland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mp4ELXKv-w)
    - Created on a shoestring budget, this unsettling film explores the fracking boom and the devastation it causes in US communities. Who knew that tap water could be set on fire?

- [Carbon Bomb: Exxon, the World Bank, & One of the Biggest Oil Discoveries of our Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chmOgYB7DGk)
    - Insightful short film made by the fantastic German organisation [urgewald](https://urgewald.org/). Let's just say that the World Bank does not look too good in this one.
- [Coming Clean: A Demand for a Fossil Free UC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N_dq9J7mDY)
    - Great short film on the fossil fuel dependency of the University of California and the chimera of carbon offsets. Produced by [Adam Aron](https://aronlab.org/climate-psychology-and-action-lab/), who [quit neuroscience](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/how-i-quit-neuroscience-focus-preventing-climate-breakdown) to focus on organizing and researching the psychology of climate action. Impressing and inspiring.
- [Climate change and the rich](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7yAk5iYm_k)
    - Very good short documentary on how the wealthy are rationalizing and protecting their carbon-intensive lifestyle. It's quite simple: They are destroying the planet and the damage is irreversible. We have to stop them.

    - Inspiring — yet gut-wrenching — documentary about 21 brave American youngsters suing the federal government for the greatest dereliction of duty in history.

    - Powerful documentary about the rise of the global youth climate movement, detailing developments before Fridays for Future put the youth on the map for many.
- [Iron Jawed Angels](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338139)
    - Iron Jawed Angels details the extraordinary nonviolent direct action campaign that Alice Paul and Lucy Burns waged as part of the women's suffrage movement in the United States in the 1910s. While at times a bit anachronistic and (too) fictional, this is a great movie to watch!
- [Don't Look Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/)
    - This is not a documentary but sharp sociopolitical commentary. Two astronomers discover a comet about to hit Earth — how will society react? The film hits so close to home it is at times painful to watch; it helps you [relate to climate scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/climate-scientist-dont-look-up-madness), who have been sounding the alarm for decades. Graphs and charts have clearly not been enough; satire and humor are [welcome allies](https://twitter.com/MichaelEMann/status/1473664359536951303).
