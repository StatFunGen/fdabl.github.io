We are in a [climate emergency](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/08/1097362). And it is getting late.

We thus need to act swiftly and with resolve, yet governments around the world are moving either [too slowly or in the wrong direction](https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/). To put pressure on them and force change, we need to build the largest, most inclusive social movement in history. Climate action has to move from something that others do to something that [we all engage in](https://twitter.com/climatehuman/status/1315065413500166144). Each and everyone of us has a role to play — this is humanity's decisive decade.

Education is an important first step. Personally, I became aware of the enormous scale and urgency of the crisis only recently, starting in the summer of 2020, when the ongoing Covid disaster compelled me to take a deeper look at the (scientific) literature. Below are some resources that I have found useful on my journey so far; note that they are in no particular order. Some of the things I have learned are summarized in a [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYEFV4feVBs).

I will try to add to this list going forward, and I hope that some things are useful to you.

Provides a good overview and the opportunity to connect with people from across the world. Be sure to also check out the Oxford Climate Society's very active [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOoksFYBCHqZWwVBU9qewZg). I especially enjoyed the events with [Noam Chomsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ81-McOgdM) and with [Anuradha Mittal and Nnimmo Bassey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7uOGgi3dCM&t=521s).
  
## Books
- [This Changes Everything](https://thischangeseverything.org/book/)
    - A book so well-researched and wide-ranging it is in a class of its own. If you read only one book on climate, make it this one.
- [The Human Planet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004703-the-human-planet)
    - How have humans become a planetary-scale geological force? This book, which grew out of a seminal article in *Nature* on [defining the Anthropocene](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14258), provides an extremely insightful and informative treatment of this and related questions. If you want to better understand our current predicament, look to the past and read this book.
- [A Global Warming Primer](https://www.globalwarmingprimer.com/the-book/)
    - This short book provides a highly accessible and informative overview of the basic science behind climate change, its consequences, and potential solutions. It also debunks a number of skeptical claims. If you need a refresher or want to get the facts straight, I highly recommend this book!
- [Doughnut Economics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29214420-doughnut-economics)
    - Kate Raworth moves beyond the suffocating corset of mainstream economics and provides a framework for (actually) sustainable development in the 21$^{\text{th}}$ century. A must read!
- [The Nutmeg's Curse](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/N/bo125517349.html)
    - In this wide-ranging and very insightful book, Amitav Ghosh traces the climate crisis back to colonialism, imperialism, and a mechanistic view of nature where it exists only as a resource to be exploited. If you want the bigger picture, this may be it. You might also enjoy [this interview](https://emergencemagazine.org/interview/beings-seen-and-unseen/) with him.
- [This is an Uprising](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25273749-this-is-an-uprising)

- [How to Blow Up a Pipeline](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/51686708-how-to-blow-up-a-pipeline)
    - Andreas Malm provides a convincing counter-narrative to the story that non-violent direct action is the key to success, noting the importance of sabotage, property destruction, and the threat of violence.

- [A Bigger Picture](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56817598-a-bigger-picture)
    - In this powerful memoir, Vanessa Nakate recounts how she became an activist, only to be cropped out by Western media. Nakate describes climate impacts and climate action in Africa, arguing that a successful climate movement must center justice and be inclusive. A very informative, insightful, and inspiring read!
- [On Fire](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/43821569-on-fire)
    - A collection of excellent essays, with topics ranging from BP's devastating oil spill in 2010 to the ascent of the Green New Deal in 2019. As Greta Thunberg notes, Naomi Klein is "the great chronicler of our age, an inspirer of generations."
- [The Future We Choose](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52117860-the-future-we-choose)
    - Christiana Figueres and Tom Rivett-Carnac, key architects of the Paris agreement, outline two futures and sketch how we can get onto the much better one.

    - World-renowned climate scientist Michael Mann has been on the frontlines ever since the publication of the ["hockey stick"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_graph). The enemy's strategy has shifted from denial to delay, and Mann — using his experience and expertise — tells us how to stay alert.

- [Merchants of Doubt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7799004-merchants-of-doubt)
    - This is one of the best and most sobering books I have ever read. Beware of science (and scientists) motivated by ideology. There exists a [documentary](https://www.documentarymania.com/player.php?title=Merchants%20of%20Doubt) of the same name, and you might also enjoy [this interview](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/podcast/2019/02/04/episode-33-naomi-oreskes-on-climate-change-and-the-distortion-of-scientific-facts/) with Naomi Oreskes.
- [Thinking in Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems)
    - "There’s so much talk about the system. And so little understanding." This book is a real classic, thought-provoking and full of insights. It also includes Donella Meadows's [famous essay on leverage points](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/). A book that deserves to be re-read from time to time.
- [Think Like a Commoner](http://thinklikeacommoner.com/)
    - There is the market and then there is the state, right? No! There is also the vast space occupied by the commons. David Bollier, who also runs a [great podcast](https://david-bollier.simplecast.com/), provides a well-written and indeed mind-expanding introduction to the commons.
- [Less is More](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53328332-less-is-more)
    - [Degrowth](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14747731.2020.1812222) is an eminently sensible proposal [worthy of discussion](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dpr.12584) and consideration. Jason Hickel, a leading proponent, compellingly argues for it in this well-written, wide-ranging, and thought-provoking book. Highly recommended!
- [The Divide](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32603498-the-divide)
    - This is an excellent book on global inequality, which makes you see the world in a different way.
- [Post Growth: Life after Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/55404479-post-growth)

- [Revolutions That Made the Earth](https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587049.001.0001/acprof-9780199587049)
    - Mother Earth has experienced a number of key revolutions that made her what she is today. This extremely informative and wide-ranging book — covering "terrain that ranges in difficulty from easy to strenuous" — will make you feel more connected to the only planet known to inhabit life.
- [Earth System Science: A Very Short Introduction](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/earth-system-science-a-very-short-introduction-9780198718871?cc=de&lang=en&)
    - Oxford University Press's "Very Short Introductions" are a great way to get an overview of any [particular topic you might imagine](https://www.veryshortintroductions.com/browse?isQuickSearch=true&pageSize=100&sort=titlesort). This and the one below are helpful if you want to dig slightly deeper into the natural science side of things.
- [Climate: A Very Short Introduction](https://www.veryshortintroductions.com/view/10.1093/actrade/9780199641130.001.0001/actrade-9780199641130)
- [The Great Derangement](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo22265507.html)

- [The Ministry for the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50998056-the-ministry-for-the-future)
    - It is difficult to imagine the future as the climate crisis worsens. Kim Stanley Robinson is here to help. Once you've read the book, you might also enjoy [this interview](https://www.thedigradio.com/podcast/near-futures-with-kim-stanley-robinson/) with him.
- [Bewilderment](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56404444-bewilderment)
    - A story about an astrobiologist father and his exceptional nine-year-old son who is bewildered by a world in pursuit of its own destruction. A book that makes you at times laugh out loud and then moves you to tears. You might also enjoy [this conversation](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/28/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-richard-powers.html) with Richard Powers.
- [The Collapse of Western Civilization](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-collapse-of-western-civilization/9780231169547)

## News / Newsletter
- [CarbonBrief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/)
    - I cannot begin to express my gratitude and appreciation for the team over at CarbonBrief. CarbonBrief is hands-down the best resource on climate; their in-depth Q&As and explainers (see for example [here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-the-ipccs-sixth-assessment-report-on-climate-science), [here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-integrated-assessment-models-are-used-to-study-climate-change), [here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-how-do-climate-models-work), [here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-nine-tipping-points-that-could-be-triggered-by-climate-change), and [here](https://www.carbonbrief.org/in-depth-qa-what-is-climate-justice)) are invaluable.
- [Mongabay](https://www.mongabay.com/)
    - Excellent news source on environmental and related issues internationally.
- [Inside Climate News](https://insideclimatenews.org/)
    - Excellent news source on environmental and related issues with a focus on the US.
- [Bill McKibben’s Substack](https://billmckibben.substack.com/)
    - Bill McKibben is a hero of the environmental movement. He used to write an extremely informative weekly newsletter, which is superseded by his Substack.
- [George Monbiot’s columns at The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgemonbiot)
    - George Monbiot, too, has been at it for decades. His weekly columns are always insightful and frequently scathing.

## Documentaries
- [The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2hSATHD634&list=PLYkO4hiKyrSRjZLQunIjgCsz4GrpDGPfN)
    - This eight-part series on how oil shaped world history is extremely informative and insightful. Highly recommended!
- [Breaking Boundaries](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14539726/)
    - In just one hour, Johan Rockström and David Attenborough summarize the science behind the [planetary boundary framework](https://www.nature.com/articles/461472a). Excellent!
- [The Corporation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpQYsk-8dWg)
    - A sobering reminder that the purpose of corporations is to generate profits, with usually scant attention paid to the social and environmental costs. This powerful film aired in 2003. [Little has changed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/oct/01/apple-amazon-microsoft-disney-lobby-groups-climate-bill-analysis).
- [David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11989890/)
    - This film is a beautiful meditation on planet Earth and its many wonders, told through the life of the world's best known naturalist. Deeply moving.
- [Tomorrow](https://www.tomorrow-documentary.com/)
    - This is a wonderful documentary showing solutions and sketching a path towards a better tomorrow, demonstrating that films on sustainability can lift your spirits. Highly recommended!
- [2040](https://whatsyour2040.com/)
    - Another informative and uplifting documentary.
- [LN3: Teachings of the Anishinaabe Resistance](https://www.stopline3.org/ln3film-video)
    - This short documentary has a ton of style. Indigenous peoples are at the frontlines fighting extractive industries. There is a lot we can learn from them.
- [Chasing Ice](https://chasingice.com/)
    - It can move surprisingly fast!
- [Chasing Coral](https://www.chasingcoral.com/)
    - This beautiful documentary will break your heart.

    - Reflections on the work of [David Fleming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fleming_(writer)) and his positive vision of what may follow  our "troubled civilization".

    - Charts the origin and fascinating history of Greenpeace.
- [The End of the Line](https://www.dartmouthfilms.com/theendoftheline)
    - Overfishing. Overfishing. Overfishing.
- [Cowspiracy](https://www.cowspiracy.com/)
    - Motivated me to look into the environmental footprint of meat and dairy in 2015, which caused me to switch to a plant-based diet. The benefits to planet and personal health are obvious — I've never looked back. Industrial agriculture alone could [blow our carbon budget](https://ourworldindata.org/food-emissions-carbon-budget), and switching to a plant-rich diet is the strongest mitigation option.
- [Seaspiracy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14152756/)
    - Similar in spirit as *Cowspiracy*. Informative but also slightly annoying.
- [Kiss the Ground](https://kisstheground.com/)
    - This documentary is uplifting and full of information, charting a promising path away from industrial agriculture (but always remember that there are no silver bullets).
- [The End of Poverty?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xpKKHcC8eU)
    - You thought it was bad? You ain't seen nothing yet.
- [The Four Horsemen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fbvquHSPJU)
    - Great selection of topics and guests. "I don't think there is anything deeper than what's on the surface. Intellectuals have to make it look complicated, that's part of their job."
- [Gasland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mp4ELXKv-w)
    - Created on a shoestring budget, this unsettling film explores the fracking boom and the devastation it causes in US communities. Who knew that tap water could be set on fire?
- [Ancient Futures: Learning from Ladakh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnWMRR6ZCgU)
    - An eye-opening natural experiment. Highly recommended!
- [Awake: A Dream From Standing Rock](https://awakethefilm.org/)
    - A good film about the struggle to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline and the brutality of the present.
- [Carbon Bomb: Exxon, the World Bank, & One of the Biggest Oil Discoveries of our Time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chmOgYB7DGk)
    - Insightful short film made by the fantastic German organisation [urgewald](https://urgewald.org/). Let's just say that the World Bank does not look too good in this one.
- [Coming Clean: A Demand for a Fossil Free UC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N_dq9J7mDY)
    - Great short film on the fossil fuel dependency of the University of California and the chimera of carbon offsets. Produced by [Adam Aron](https://aronlab.org/climate-psychology-and-action-lab/), who [quit neuroscience](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/how-i-quit-neuroscience-focus-preventing-climate-breakdown) to focus on organizing and researching the psychology of climate action. Impressing and inspiring.
- [Don't Look Up](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11286314/)
    - This is not a documentary but sharp sociopolitical commentary. Two astronomers discover a comet about to hit Earth — how will society react? The film hits so close to home it is at times painful to watch; it helps you [relate to climate scientists](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/dec/29/climate-scientist-dont-look-up-madness), who have been sounding the alarm for decades. Graphs and charts have clearly not been enough; satire and humor are [welcome allies](https://twitter.com/MichaelEMann/status/1473664359536951303).
